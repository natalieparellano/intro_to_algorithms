**Problem:** show how to implement a queue using two stacks. Analyze the running time of the queue operations. 

**Thoughts:** imagine two stacks `S1` and `S2` ...we can push all of the elements onto the end of `S1`. Each operation takes `O(1)` time. To dequeue an element, we'd need to pop off each element of `S1` and push it onto `S2`, until `S1` has only one element, which is the element we want to dequeue. At this point, if we wanted to dequeue additional elements, each element could be dequeued in order by popping it off of `S2`. But as soon as we wanted to enqueue an element, we'd need to pop off all the elements of `S2` and push them back onto `S1` so that they would be in the proper order. Therefore dequeuing an element takes `O(2n)`, or just `O(n)` time, with some gains in efficiency if we are dequeuing multiple elements in succession.
